You need JDK (Java Developer Kit), which provides both runtime and the compiler.


If you get any error then probably you don't have JDK 8 or higher installed. Type

    javac -version

to find the version of java compiler you have. If it says that - No such command found or something like that, then you probably don't have JDK installed or it is not properly set up.
